# Inspector Guide (Stub)

The inspector is responsible for rendering rich in-game overlays that show information about blocks, entities, NBT data, and performance metrics.

This repository snapshot does not yet include the full inspector implementation, but the key concepts are:

- Block & entity inspection with on-screen overlays.
- Optional NBT data view for advanced debugging.
- Packet monitor and performance metrics overlays.

Refer to the README and future versions of this repository for a complete implementation and API details.
